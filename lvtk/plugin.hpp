/** @mainpage LV2 Toolkit

    @section intro Introduction
    These documents describe some C++ classes that may be of use if you want
    to write LV2 plugins in C++. They implement most of the boilerplate code
    so you only have to write the parts that matter, and hide the low-level
    C API.

    <b>Libraries</b>
    The classes are separated into two libraries. One, called liblvtk-plugin,
    contains the classes Plugin and Synth, defined in the files
    <lvtk/plugin.hpp> and <lvtk/synth.hpp>. They are base classes that you
    can inherit in order to create new LV2 plugins. The other library, called
    liblvtk-ui, contains the class UI, defined in the file <lvtk/ui.hpp>
    which you can use in a similar way to create new LV2 plugin UIs.

    <b>Packages</b>
    There are a few included pkg-config packages to choose from when writing
    a plugins and UIs.  Below is a list of all packages included and what they
    are for.

    - <b>lvtk-plugin</b> - Use when writing an LV2 plugin
    - <b>lvtk-ui</b> - Use if NOT using a @ref toolkitmixins "Toolkit Mixin"
    - <b>lvtk-gtkui</b> - Use if using the GtkUI @ref toolkitmixins "Toolkit Mixin"

    In summary, there is one package for a plugin and one for each
    type of supported UI. Each UI package includes the same static library plus
    dependencies of its cooresponding toolkit.

    <b>Mixins</b>
    For both the plugin and the GUI class there are other helper classes called
    @ref pluginmixins "mixins" that you can use to add extra functionality to
    your plugins, for example support for LV2 extensions.

    <b>Versioning</b>
    These libraries are only available as static libraries (and most of the
    code is template classes in header files), thus ABI stability is not an
    issue. The API will be stable between major version bumps, at which the
    pkg-config name would change to prevent plugins from building against an
    incompatible version.

namespace lvtk {

    using std::vector;

    /** @internal
        A thin wrapper around std::vector<LV2_Descriptor> that frees the URI
        members of the descriptors. */
    class DescList : public vector<LV2_Descriptor> {
    public:
        ~DescList();
    };


    /** @internal
        This returns a list of all registered plugins. It is only used
        internally. */
    DescList& get_lv2_descriptors();


    /** This is a template base class for LV2 plugins. It has default
        implementations for all functions, so you only have to implement the
        functions that you need (for example run()). All subclasses must have
        a constructor whose signature matches the one in the example code below,
        otherwise it will not work with the register_class() function. The
        host will use this @c double parameter to pass the sample rate that the
        plugin should run at when it creates a new instance of the plugin.

        This is a template so that simulated dynamic binding can be used for
        the callbacks. This is not all that useful for simple plugins but it may
        come in handy when using @ref pluginmixins "mixins" and it doesn't add
        any additional vtable lookup and function call costs, like real dynamic
        binding would.
@code
      #include <cstring>
      #include <lvtk/plugin.hpp>

      class TestLV2 : public Plugin<TestLV2>
      {
      public:

        TestLV2(double) : plugin<TestLV2>(2) { }

        void run(uint32_t sample_count)
        {
          std::memcpy(p(1), p(0), sample_count * sizeof(float));
        }

      };

      static unsigned _ = TestLV2::register_class("http://lvtoolkit.org/plugins/TestLV2");
@endcode

        If the above code is compiled and linked with @c -ldaps-plugin0 into a
        shared module, it could form the shared object part of a fully
        functional (but not very useful) LV2 plugin with one audio input port
        and one audio output port that just copies the input to the output.

        You can extend your plugin classes, for example adding support for
        LV2 extensions, by passing @ref pluginmixins "mixin classes" as template
        parameters to plugin (second template parameter and onwards).

        If you want to write a synth plugin you should probably inherit the
        Synth class instead of this one.
