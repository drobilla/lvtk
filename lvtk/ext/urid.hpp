                of the plugin.  Plugins that intend to perform string comparison on
                unmapped URIs SHOULD first canonicalise URI strings with a call to
                map_uri() followed by a call to unmap_uri().

                If the ID does not already exist, it will be created.

                This function is referentially transparent; any number of calls with the
                same arguments is guaranteed to return the same value over the life of a
                plugin instance.  Note, however, that several URIs MAY resolve to the
                same ID if the host considers those URIs equivalent.

                This function is not necessarily very fast or RT-safe: plugins SHOULD
                cache any IDs they might need in performance critical situations.

                The return value 0 is reserved and indicates that an ID for that URI
                could not be created for whatever reason.  However, hosts SHOULD NOT
                return 0 from this function in non-exceptional circumstances (i.e. the
                URI map SHOULD be dynamic).

                @param uri The URI to be mapped to an integer ID.
